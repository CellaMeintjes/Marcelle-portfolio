
<h1>Marcelle Meintjes | About Me</h1>
<h3>Hi there! I'm Marcelle</h3>
<p>A passionate software engineer and web developer with a 
    unique background in education. For the past 10 years, I've had the privilege of teaching 
    and shaping young minds, and along the way, I discovered a new passion—coding! <br />
    What started as a way to better support my students has grown into a full-fledged love for 
    programming and tech innovation.</p>
  
  <p>Known for my determination and teamwork, I thrive on solving problems and learning new 
      things. My enthusiasm for coding drives me to continuously improve, and I’m always up for a 
      challenge. From classrooms to code, my journey has been one of adaptability,
      curiosity, and a dedication to getting things done.</p>
  
  <p>Most recently, I completed a Software Engineering Bootcamp with HyperionDev, graduating with a 99% average. <br />
    I'm also diving into web development through a course by Dr. Angela Yu, 
    where I’m expanding my skills and exploring the endless possibilities of the digital world.</p> 
  
  <p>Outside of work, I'm a proud wife (5 years and counting!) and a mom to two energetic 
    little girls, aged 3 and 4.<br />
    Balancing family and tech life keeps me on my toes, and I wouldn’t have it any other way!</p>
  
  <p>I believe technology is an incredible tool 
    for learning and creativity, and I’m excited to see where this journey takes me next!</p>
